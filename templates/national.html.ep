                        <h2>Our vision</h2>
                        Canada is undergoing radical change at a time when our national media is in collapse. In two years there will be another federal election. Canada needs more diverse reporting to inform that democratic moment -- reporting that cares more about your values than shareholder profits. That's what The Tyee has done for more than 10 years in B.C., garnering numerous reporting awards and a loyal readership. So, join us now and together we'll bring this spirit to the national conversation.

                        <h2>How you can help</h2>
                        <p>Your money will pay proven journalists to cover the national stories other media miss. What stories exactly? You tell us. When you sign up, you'll complete a news-priority survey that will help inform this reporting. Choose from priorities like energy &amp; environment, trade &amp; foreign affairs or inequality. Plus, your money keeps The Tyee paywall free, which means you're giving the gift of excellent independent reporting to all Canadians, regardless of income level. Because news is for the people. But good reporting costs money.

                        <p>For years, politicians have been playing with you. Now it's your turn to play with them. In anticipation of the 2015 federal election, we present The Party Leader Paper Dolls. Just a little gift from the political nerds at The Tyee to the political nerds who subscribe at $15/month or higher levels. Prorogue away, parliamentary puppet master! <a href="http://TheTyee.ca/About/National/Paper-Dolls">See the dolls...</a>

                        <h2>Why now?</h2>
                        In the last two years, federal scientists have been muzzled, far-reaching trade deals have been negotiated in secret, environmental programs have been slashed, and inequality has increased. At the same time, the oil and gas industry has held unprecedented sway in the public policy of the nation. The next federal election is in two years. The time for tough, fact-driven reporting is now.
